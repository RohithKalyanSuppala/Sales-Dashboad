# Sales-Dashboad-Using-PowerBi
# Overview
A Sales Data Dashboad typically includes key insights into the performance of a business's sales over a defined period. It helps stakeholders understand trends, performance drivers, and areas for improvement.

In this project, we leverage Power BI's robust data visualization and analytics capabilities to perform the following tasks:
-	Data preprocessing and cleaning
-	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-	Sales Data calculation and trend analysis
